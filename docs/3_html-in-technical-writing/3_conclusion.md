# Conclusion

You've just completed a brief introduction to WYSIWYG editors. These editors are often used in Content Management Systems (CMS) to unify and control content. While WYSIWYG to HTML editors can make it easier to write content for the web, these editors are often not perfect and require you to be able to manually edit HTML.

There are many popular CMS out there, such as MadCap, ZenDesk, SalesForce, Jira, and Confluence. We used SalesForce is our example, but every CMS will operate differently. However, being familiar with one CMS means you will be able to pick up a new CMS more quickly. In an interview, you'll have the benefit of knowing what a CRM is. We recommend you look at job postings to see if a CRM is listed. From there, you can most likely look up publicly available tutorials and documentation.
