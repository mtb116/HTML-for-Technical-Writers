# HTML Applied in Technical Writing

Youâ€™ve learned the basics of HTML but how is HTML applied in context for technical writers?
Technical writers sometimes interact with HTML when editing and publishing content. Typically, technical writers will use a Content Management System (CMS software), such as MadCap Flare or SalesForce, that offer HTML integration as part of their services. A CMS allows writers to use a WYSIWYG editor (an acronym for What You See Is What You Get, pronounced WIZ-ee-wig) to output HTML code. Inevitably though, a WYSIWYG editor will output HTML code with formatting mistakes which must be fixed manually.

It is helpful for technical writers to have a basic, general knowledge of HTML structure; enough to ensure it displays correctly. This requires the skill to read HTML and to recognize and correct HTML formatting errors.
