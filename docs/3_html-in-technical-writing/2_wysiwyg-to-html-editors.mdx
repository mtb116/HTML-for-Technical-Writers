The following video is an example of a WYSIWYG to HTML editor using SalesForce, a popular Content Management System (CMS) software.

Every CMS operates differently. We chose SalesForce to use as an example because it has a very intuitive editor. Plus, SalesForce offers a free trial of their software if you want to try it out yourself.
