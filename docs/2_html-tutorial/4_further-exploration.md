# Further Exploration

You have now learned the fundamental building blocks of HTML. Being proficient in any coding language does not rely on memorization or having a fixed set of skills. As you are required to use HTML in your future work, the more you’ll become comfortable with it. 

You can look up HTML elements and attributes as you need them. Explore resources available and some that we recommend are:

1. [W3Schools HTML Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)

    W3Schools is an excellent glossary of all HTML elements available. If you are not sure what HTML element to use, one approach is to google it and likely w3schools will appear.

2. [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

    MDN Web Docs is another glossary-like resource similar to W3Schools. Maintained by Mozilla, MDN Web Docs documents offer more background and technical explanation.

3. [HTML5 W3C](https://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-LC/)

    The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) develops the standards and guidelines for HTML. HTML5 is the latest major update to HTML in 2014. This is the actual technical documentation for modern HTML. As such it is not very beginner friendly. You don’t need to feel comfortable using this site and we recommend using it in tandem with resources like W3Schools and MDN.
