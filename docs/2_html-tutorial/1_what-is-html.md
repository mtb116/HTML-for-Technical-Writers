# What is HTML?

When writing a report or an article, you likely have standards for how words should be formatted. You may follow the convention that the first line of paragraphs should be indented, or vice versa that all lines after the first line are indented. You have conventions for how to denote quotes, when to bold or italics text, and how to format the header, title, references, etc.

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a coding language that is used to standardize the structure and formatting of text documents intended to be displayed in a web browser. HTML is at the core of every webpage you see on the internet, regardless of the complexity of the website.

All formatted digital content relies on a markup language. HTML is by far the most standard meaning it is the most widely used and applicable to many professions.
